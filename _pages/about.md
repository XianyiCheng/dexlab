**The Robot Dexterity Lab @ Duke University**

The research goal of the Robot Dexterity Lab (DexLab) is human-level dexterity in robotic manipulation. In the DexLab, we believe that dexterity is a crucial manipulation capability that all robots will have in the future. Dexterity is not just manipulation with complex, high-DoF hands; it is the motion intelligence with vast complexity that still awaits more understanding.

Currently, we are exploring questions such as:

- How do we develop robot manipulation skills that are generalizable across tasks and transferable across robots?
- What new forms of dexterity are possible, and can all robots be dexterous in manipulation?
- What is the fundamental complexity of manipulation? Can we develop a formal framework to characterize its difficulty, robustness, and evaluation methods?
- What infrastructure best supports the development, integration, and benchmarking of generalizable manipulation skills?
